# Test Strategy Document

## Project Overview

The project involves writing automated tests for a calculator application that is run within a Docker container. The primary focus is on testing the core functionalities of the calculator by interacting with it through the command line. The tests will be written using Playwright and TypeScript to validate functionality.

## Objectives

- To ensure the reliability and correctness of the calculator's core functionalities.
- To cover basic and edge cases to validate the robustness and accuracy of the calculator’s operations.
- To deliver a comprehensive automation solution that can be run within the Docker environment.

## Test Scope

The test scope includes automated testing of the calculator's functionalities within a Docker container. The tests should encompass:

- **Basic Arithmetic Operations:** Addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- **Edge Cases:** Handling of division by zero, large numbers, and invalid inputs.
- **Command-Line Interaction:** Validation of correct outputs and error handling when interacting with the calculator via command-line commands.

## Testing Approach

1. **Scenario Identification:** Identify key functionalities and edge cases for automation based on the requirements of the calculator application.
2. **Test Case Design:** Design test cases to cover basic operations and edge cases, including validation of expected output and error messages.
3. **Test Script Development:** Develop test scripts using Playwright and TypeScript to interact with the Docker container and execute calculator commands. Ensure that tests are modular and reusable.
4. **Execution and Validation:** Run the Docker container, execute the tests, and validate the calculator’s functionality against expected outcomes. Verify that all scenarios produce the correct results and handle errors as expected.
5. **Reporting and Documentation:** Document test results, findings, and any issues encountered during the testing process. Provide clear instructions for running the tests and interpreting the results.

## Risks and Mitigation

- **Environment Stability:** Ensure that the Docker container and environment are stable and consistent to prevent disruptions during test execution.
- **Application Changes:** Monitor for any changes to the application that may impact test script functionality and update the scripts as needed.
- **Command Execution:** Verify that commands are correctly executed and results are accurately captured from the Docker container.

## Deliverables

- Automated test scripts written in Playwright with TypeScript.
- A GitHub repository containing the solution.
- Descriptive commit messages providing a clear history of work.
- README file with instructions on running the tests and interpreting results.
- Summary of findings and any encountered issues with resolutions.
- Explanation of the approach and decision-making process.
